# Getting started

## Installation

Install using `pip`:

```
pip install maestro-python
```

## Setting up Django backend

The Django backend contains a Django app that integrates with your Django application. To add it to your project, you first need to set some things up in your `settings.py` file.

Add `"maestro.backends.django"` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` setting.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    "maestro.backends.django",
]
```

Add `"maestro.backends.django.contrib.middleware.SyncQueueMiddleware"` to you `MIDDLEWARE` setting.

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...
    "maestro.backends.django.contrib.middleware.SyncQueueMiddleware",
]
```

Then, define some basic settings to instruct maestro about what needs to be synchronized:

```python
MAESTRO = {
    # This indicates which models will be sinchronized
    "MODELS": [
        "myapp.mymodel",
        "myapp.myothermodel",
    ],

    # This is the path to a function that will be called
    # at the end of a request whenever
    # changes are made to any of the models listed
    "CHANGES_COMMITTED_CALLBACK": "path.to.callback.function"
}
```

Lastly, you have to define the callback function that will be called whenever changes are made to the models being synchronized. This callback should initiate a synchronization session, so that the data is replicated to the other node.

You can see below a sample implementation of this callback. It will spin up a synchronization session in a separate thread so as not to block the request. In this sample, the data is being synchronized between a Django application and Firestore.

```python

from maestro.backends.django.contrib.factory import create_django_provider
from maestro.backends.firestore.contrib.factory import create_firestore_provider
import maestro.backends.firestore
import maestro.backends.django
from maestro.core.orchestrator import SyncOrchestrator
from firebase_admin import firestore
import threading
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING


def on_changes_commited():
    thread = threading.Thread(target=start_sync, args=["django"])
    thread.start()

def start_sync(initial_source_provider_id: "str"):

    # Django
    django_provider = create_django_provider()

    # Firestore
    firestore_provider = create_firestore_provider()

    # Sync lock
    sync_lock = maestro.backends.django.DjangoSyncLock()

    # Orchestrator
    orchestrator = SyncOrchestrator(
        sync_lock=sync_lock,
        providers=[django_provider, firestore_provider],
        maximum_duration_seconds=10 * 60,
    )
    orchestrator.run(initial_source_provider_id=initial_source_provider_id)

```

To finish things off, run Django's `migrate` command so that Maestro creates the necessary tables:

    ./manage.py migrate
